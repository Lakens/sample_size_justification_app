# Sample Size Justification App

This Shiny app accompanies the paper 'Sample Size Justification' by DaniÃ«l Lakens. You can download the pre-print of this article at (PsyArXiV)[https://psyarxiv.com/9d3yf/]. You can help to improve this form by providing feedback or suggest additions by filling out (this form)[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdWAtBdv2VnlIWMwSeHK9syZnAw5P2Q9yJs_9hvFy0j9daSYQ/viewform?usp=sf_link]. 

You can download the app and run it locally. A version will be uploaded to my shiny server in the near future. 

To do:

- Add sample size info to HTML report
- Check spelling throughout
- Check if report compiles if only partial information is provided.
